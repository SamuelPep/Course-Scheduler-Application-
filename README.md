ðŸ“š Course Scheduler Application

Submitted by: Samuel Peprah Millner

The Course Scheduler Application is a Java-based desktop program built using Swing for the GUI and Apache Derby as the embedded SQL database. It allows students and administrators at a university to schedule, manage, and drop courses each semester. The GUI leverages JComboBox components to dynamically display and manage student, course, and semester data.

Time spent: ~12â€“15 hours (design, implementation, debugging, and GUI wiring)

âœ… Required Features

The following functionality was implemented and tested for both Admin and Student roles:
	â€¢	Add & Drop Courses: Students can schedule or drop courses; admins can drop entire courses and view enrolled students.



 
	â€¢	Waitlist Management: Automatically adds students to the waitlist if a class is full and promotes them when space becomes available.


 
	â€¢	Display Features: Admins can view student lists per class and semester, and students can view their own schedule.




 
	â€¢	Dynamic ComboBoxes: Drop-down menus are auto-populated with real-time data from the database (e.g., course codes, semesters, student names).

ðŸ”§ Technical Overview

The application utilizes:
	â€¢	Java Swing GUI components (JComboBox, JLabel, JButton, etc.) to provide a user-friendly interface.



 
	â€¢	Apache Derby for persistent storage of student, course, schedule, and semester information.


 
	â€¢	SQL queries and PreparedStatements for all data operationsâ€”ensuring secure and efficient communication with the database.


 
	â€¢	OOP Design with separation of concerns:


 
	â€¢	StudentQueries, CourseQueries, ClassQueries, ScheduleQueries, etc. handle DB interaction.




 
	â€¢	MainFrame.java handles GUI logic and user interaction.

GUI Design Guidelines Implemented:
	â€¢	Students/Admins select known data (e.g., names, semesters) via ComboBoxes.



 
	â€¢	All display results and operation confirmations appear directly on the same GUI pane without needing extra display steps.

ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Practiced
	â€¢	Java Swing GUI development


 
	â€¢	SQL database integration using JDBC


 
	â€¢	Object-Oriented Design (separating queries, models, and UI logic)



 
	â€¢	Dynamic UI updates with real-time database feedback

 
	â€¢	PreparedStatements to prevent SQL injection

â¸»

ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
	â€¢	Structuring the application cleanly across multiple user types (Admin vs. Student)

 
	â€¢	Managing ComboBox state and syncing changes with live database updates


 
	â€¢	Ensuring database changes cascade correctly when classes or students are dropped


 
	â€¢	Avoiding UI flickering and redundant DB calls during display updates

â¸»

ðŸ§ª Testing
	â€¢	Ran through a variety of trace-based test scenarios (manual and scripted) including:

 
	â€¢	Dropping full courses and confirming waitlist promotion

 
	â€¢	Dropping students and validating that schedules and waitlists update accordingly

 
	â€¢	Displaying students by class and verifying waitlist order
